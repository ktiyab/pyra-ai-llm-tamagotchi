  "description": "Browser-based AI Virtual Pet Simulator combining classic Tamagotchi-style mechanics with GenAI to create personality-driven pets.\n\nPyra is a virtual pet simulation built around an interconnected economy of needs and bonds. Six basic needs (hunger, warmth, attention, rest, play, and cleanliness) decay over time at rates influenced by the creature's current life stage and emotional state—a scared Pyra loses attention 1.8× faster, while an excited one burns through energy at 1.5× the normal rate. These needs feed into two relationship stats: Trust, which grows through attentive care (especially when needs are critical) and decays through neglect, and Respect, which is shaped exclusively by how Pyra responds to commands. The system creates meaningful feedback loops—for instance, running animations drain energy, which increases hunger, and if hunger drops too low, rest recovery is halved and the creature becomes less compliant, making training harder. Every interaction ripples through multiple stats, making care feel consequential rather than mechanical.\n\nWhat elevates Pyra beyond traditional virtual pets is its learned behavior system, which creates genuine personality emergence through play. An LLM generates contextual responses, emotions, and animations based on Pyra's current state, while a parallel system tracks six personality dimensions (fearfulness, attachment, obedience, energy disposition, trust disposition, and temperament) that shift based on how the player treats their pet. Comfort a scared Pyra, and it grows more confident; neglect it during distress, and it becomes fearful. These shifts are most pronounced during early life stages (hatchlings have 2× plasticity) and solidify as Pyra matures. Significant events—being rescued from starvation, feeling truly loved, or being abandoned—become permanent memories that the LLM references in future interactions, creating a creature that genuinely reflects its upbringing. The result is that no two Pyras are alike: one raised with patience and consistency becomes trusting and eager to please, while one raised through neglect becomes suspicious, clingy, or rebellious—a living record of the relationship you've built together.",
